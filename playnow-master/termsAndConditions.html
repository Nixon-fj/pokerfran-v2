                            <li>You can only use the Online Casino and/or the Website if you are the legal age as
                                determined by the law of the country where you live.</li>
                            <li>You cannot use the Online Casino and/or the Website if you are under 18 years of age in

                            <li>Some legal jurisdictions have not addressed the legality of online gambling and others
                                have specifically made online gambling illegal. We do not intend that anyone should use
                                the Online Casino and/or the Website where such use is illegal. The availability of the
                                Online Casino and/or the Website does not construe an offer or invitation by us to use
                                the Online Casino in any country in which such use is illegal. Use of the Online Casino
                                is void wherever prohibited by any applicable law. You accept sole responsibility for
                                determining whether your use of the Online Casino is legal in the country where you
