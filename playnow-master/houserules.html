                                The lines and odds are the same as those of the original wager
                            </li>

                        After wagers are placed by telephone, the clerk will read back the wagers. If the read back or
                        confirmation is correct, client must re-confirm wagers by stating their client number and
                        password. If any mistakes were made by the clerk, it is the responsibility of the client to tell
                        the clerk before the call is completed. Once the client confirms a read back the wagers are
                        final. If a client does not confirm his plays by giving his code and password and hangs up
                        before the read back all plays are considered final.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the client has phone problems and is cut off before getting a read back, it is his
                        responsibility to call as soon as possible and verify his pending wagers. If the client gave the
                        clerk a team and amount before getting cut off the wagers will go into the system even though
                        there was no read back.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wagers are graded only after the contest is final.
