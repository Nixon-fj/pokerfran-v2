                                <h2>Baseball lines</h2>
                                <p>Baseball games can be wagered three different ways: Money Line, Run Line and Totals.
                                    For the Totals and Run Lines we use a 20 cent line. The favorite has the negative
                                    number next to it showing the price you have to lay to play that side and the
                                    underdog almost always has a positive number next to it showing the price you would
                                    win by playing it. Below is an example of a typical baseball game.</p>
                                <p>Mets - Hampton -134 9ov -105
                                    Marlins - Dempster +124 9un -115</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If you want to place a $100 wager on the Mets, you would be risking $134 to win
                                        $100.</li>
                                    <li>If you want to place a $100 wager on the Marlins, you would risk $100 to win
                                        $124.</li>
                                    <li>If you want to place a $100 wager on over 9 runs, you would risk $105 to win
                                        $100.</li>
                                    <li>If you want to place a $100 wager on under 9 runs, you would risk $115 to win
                                        $100.</li>
                                    <li>When betting Baseball Money Lines you can chose the following options for your
                                        wagers: ACTION, LISTED PITCHERS (LP), YOUR TEAM'S PITCHER (PT) or OPPOSING
                                        PITCHER (TP).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When an MLB team has ACTION as the starting pitcher, any pitcher that starts will
                                    constitute action.</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>NOTE: The starting pitchers are determined after the first pitch. In the event of
                                        a pitching change prior to the game, the money price may be adjusted and your
                                        bet may change if you play with action.</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <h3>Action:</h3>
                                <p>Your wager is team against team regardless of who the starting pitchers are. In case
                                    of a pitching change, your price will be adjusted to the opening number of the
                                    actual starting pitcher.</p>
                                <h3>Listed Pitchers (LP):</h3>
                                <p>Your wager is predicated on both listed pitchers throwing at least one pitch for you
                                    to have action. Both pitchers must start in order for you to have action on your
                                    wager, otherwise the bet will be declared NO ACTION after the game is final.</p>
                                <h3>Your team's Pitcher (PT):</h3>
                                <p>You are only taking the listed pitcher of the team you are wagering on. The pitcher
                                    selected must start the game for your wager to count. Any pitcher can start for the
                                    opposing team. In case of a pitching change on the opposing team, the price will
                                    still adjust to the opening price of the actual starters.</p>
                                <h3>Opposing Pitcher (TP):</h3>
                                <p>You are listing the opposing team's pitcher. Any starter can pitch for the team you
                                    selected. The opposing team's pitcher has to start. In the case of a pitching change
                                    on your team, the price will be adjusted to the opening price of the actual
                                    pitchers.
                                    The other way to wager on a baseball game is to bet the run-line. Every favorite
                                    will be - 1 ½ runs and could either be plus or minus money.</p>
                                <p>Below is an example of what a run-line looks like.</p>
                                <p>Mets - Hampton +1 ½ +115
                                    Marlins - Dempster -1 ½ -135
                                    If you wager $100 on the Mets, you have the Mets minus 1 ½ runs risking $100 to win
                                    $115. If you wager $100 on the Marlins, you have the Marlins plus 1 ½ runs risking
                                    $135 to win $100.</p>
                                <p>When wagering on Total Runs (over/under) and Run Lines (run spread) the game must go
                                    9 innings (8 ½ if the home team is winning). If the game is suspended after 9
                                    innings, the final score (for wagering purposes) is determined by the last full
                                    inning of play unless the home team scores to tie or takes the lead in the bottom
                                    half of the inning. In which case, the winner is determined by the score when the
                                    game is called. If with this rules the game is a TIE, Run Lines and Totals count.
                                    All wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are ALWAYS with Listed Pitchers (LP). If both
                                    pitchers scheduled to pitch at the time of the wager do not throw at least one pitch
                                    then the wager will be cancelled. Wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are refunded in
                                    the event of a pitching change when the game is final.</p>
                                <p>We do NOT accept Parlays, If Bets or Round Robins with the same game's Total and Run

                                    are scheduled for 7 Innings only and are completed (6.5 if home team is winning) are

                                    half lines are action regardless of the pitcher. If Games are suspended and MORE

                                <p>College World Series games (all college baseball games) that are suspended are
                                    considered to be in a long rain delay and will be graded when the game reaches its
                                    official ending.</p>

                                <p>NCAA regular season Softball --- Games ending early as a result of a mercy rule will
                                    have action on all wagers (unless otherwise noted). If a game is suspended or
                                    postponed due to weather or darkness all bets will be considered NO ACTION</p>
                                <p>NCAA Post season --- Games ending early as a result of a mercy rule will have action
                                    on all wagers including TOTALS (unless otherwise noted). If a game is suspended or
                                    postponed due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until the game is

                                <p>Little League Baseball --- Games ending early as a result of a mercy rule will have
                                    action on all wagers including TOTALS (unless otherwise noted). If a game is
                                    suspended or postponed due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until

                                <p>For the World Baseball Classic (WBC), during the first two rounds of play, both sides
                                    and totals have action regardless of the Mercy Rule. For the Semi Finals and Final
                                    of the WBC, the Mercy Rule is not in effect therefore games will follow normal
                                    playoff rules. In case of discrepancy or items not covered, Las Vegas gaming rules
                                    will apply.</p>
                                <p>Totals, Runs, Hits and Errors: A game must go 8 and a half innings if home team is
                                    winning, or 9 if the road team is winning for action.</p>
                                <p>GRAND SALAMI For grand salami wagers, every game on the board has to go the full 9
                                    innings (8½ if the home team is winning) otherwise it will be cancelled.</p>
                                <p>Pitchers do not matter, meaning that if there is a pitching change on any game your
                                    bet will still have action.</p>
                                <p>For League Grand Salami, it will only take to account games played on that specific
                                    league, example: National League Grand Salami will only include games from the
                                    National League schedule and not National League teams that could be playing on
                                    Interleague games.</p>
                                <p>** Exception: Playoff baseball games do not fall under the suspended game rule in
                                    accordance to Major League Baseball guidelines to finish all games. If a game is
                                    suspended due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until the game is
                                    declared final.</p>

                                    is made at the 22:35 the official time for that goal will be 23:00.
                                    For example, if the time of the Early Goal was set at 26:00 and the goal was made at
                                    25:20 making the official time of that goal 26:00, then NO GOAL BEFORE 26:00 will be

                                    <li>Top Player in a group: On major tournaments we offer pools such as TOP AMERICAN
                                        player in the tournament. In such pools if ties for the best position occur, the

                                <h2>Dead Heat Rule</h2>
                                <p>For golf wagers containing more than two participants such as 3 Balls, 6 Ball
                                    Shooter, Top players in a group and Round leader (S) for example where two or more
                                    players tie for the same place the dead heat rule is applied as follows: The wager
                                    is reduced according to how many players tie and is then applied to the full odds
                                    with the remainder of the stake deemed as lost.</p>
                                <p>For example:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>You wager $150 at odds of +200 and 2 players tie for the same position, Half the
                                        stake is lost -$75, the other half wins and is paid the same odds. So $75 wins
                                        at +200 = $150 - $75 = $75 net.</li>
                                    <li>If 3 players tie for the same position then: Two thirds of the stake is lost
                                        -$100, the remaining third $50 wins at +200.
                                        Please note this rule does not apply to two player matchups where a tie results
                                        in a push.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>For Matchups the player must tee off in order to be considered action. If a player
                                    does not tee off, then any wager involving him would be considered no action and
                                    will be cancelled.The exception to this rule is when the wager is made on a pool and
                                    all players have action regardless if they start or not the tournament. (ex: to win
                                    TOURNAMENT)</p>
                                <p>If a players tees off, he is in action regardless of the number of holes played.</p>
                                <p>Example of a Tournament Matchup:</p>
                                <p>Fred Funk - 125
                                    Joe Durant +105
                                    In this tournament match-If a customer picks Fred Funk, the wager is on Fred Funk to
                                    have a better record than Joe Durant. Not necessarily that Funk must win the
                                    championship but that he will end up in a better position than Durant. Both players
                                    must Tee Off in the tournament for the matchup to have action. In a two-player
                                    match-up wager, the player completing the most holes is declared the winner. If both
                                    players complete the same number of holes then the lowest score wins.</p>
                                <p>Specific Rounds: Aside the odds to win the whole Tournament, we may also offer odds
                                    to win a specific round. So a customer can bet on a player to win the 3rd round
                                    only. If this is the case we will specify that the bet is for the round only and not
                                    for the whole tournament. Both players must tee off in the specified round for
                                    action. 4th round does not include playoffs</p>
                                <p>When a point scoring method is used such as Stableford, then the highest number of
                                    point wins. The only exception to this rule is when a tournament is rain shortened
                                    and the final scores are determined by the PGA usually by reverting back to the last
                                    completed round.</p>
                                <p>We ONLY accept Straight Bets when wagering on Golf regardless if it is a wager on To
                                    Win Tournament, Top 5, Top 10, Tournament Matchups, Round Matchups or Top Player

                                    Bets, Reverses and/or Round Robins) will be cancelled by us without prior notice.

                                <p>For boxing there are three types of wagers:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>To Win the Fight: Picking the fighter that the customer thinks will win the
                                        fight. Draws will cancel these wagers.</li>
                                    <li>Total of Rounds: Customer will either go over or under a number of rounds in
                                        which the fight will be finished.</li>
                                    <li>Correct Result Wagering: Players can wager on which boxer will win the fight and
                                        the manner in which the fight is won. A KNOCKOUT includes Technical Knockouts
                                        (TKO) and Disqualifications (DQ). A DECISION is determined to be anytime the
                                        judge's scorecards are used to determine the winner of the bout regardless of
                                        the round in which this occurs. DRAW is a wagering option and if a DRAW occurs
                                        the other Correct Result Wagers will be losers.
                                        Lets say the line on the rounds in a fight is 4.5 (3 minutes). If a player takes
                                        the over, he's saying that the fight will last more than 4.5 rounds. That would
                                        be 4 full rounds and the first 1.5 minutes into the 5th round (1 minute and 30
                                        seconds).</li>

                                    <li>To Win the Tournament: Customers bet on one of the players to be the champion of

                                    <li>To Win the Match: Picking the player that the customer thinks will win the
                                        match. The match is official if a ball gets served. After that, if a player

                                        all wagers in the 1st set to have action. If after the 1st set is completed the
                                        match gets cancelled for any reason, all 1st set wagers are still considered
                                        good.</li>

                                    be completed for wagers to have action, if one of the players retires or by other
                                    causes the match is not finished then all wagers will be considered NO ACTION.</p>

                                <p>We ONLY accept Straight Bet Wagering on Tennis matchups, props and futures. Any Other

                                    then all wagers related to GAMES will be voided.
                                    If a match is decided this way, then the match tiebreak will be considered to be the
                                    3rd set, and for betting purposes, the winner will be awarded a 2-1 sets win.</p>

                                        <p>Handicap betting: A spread in E-Sports can be Rounds/Maps or other counting
                                            measures dependent on the game. The spread will only be referred to as the
                                            spread. (For example, in Counter Strike the spread will be rounds won, while
                                            in Starcraft 2 the spread would be maps).
                                            <strong>Handicapping is a way of making a sports contest more even and thus
                                                more interesting as a betting object. In E-Sports betting, this is done
                                                by awarding one of the teams/players, the underdog, some maps/rounds
